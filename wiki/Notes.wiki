#summary Things that we've learned the hard way and don't want to forget.

= SVN =

For Xcode projects, add "`*`.pbxuser `*`.mode1v3 build" to the global-ignores line in ~/.subversion/config. This removes user-specific settings in the project file as well as build files from svn status, etc.

After adding a repository, the initial checkout, opening the associated project, and configuring SCM, Xcode doesn't show the full SCM menu until Xcode is restarted.

= OpenCL =

clGetDeviceInfo often returns incorrect CPU and GPU details, such as CPU count & GPU memory stats.

= Xcode =

C source in a separate bundle/plugin target blows up by default. For now we're including Divvy_Prefix.pch in the DivvyPlugin framework and using that as the precompiled header for all bundles. Alternatively one can mark the c file as objc as described in [http://lists.apple.com/archives/xcode-users/2009/Mar/msg00199.html this thread].
