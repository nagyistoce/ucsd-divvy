#summary Things to remember when developing a Divvy plugin.

The prefix header for the plugin needs to be set to Divvy_Prefix.pch.

= Required resources =
  * The main plugin class DivvyYourPluginName (e.g. DivvyPCA), it must conform to one and only one of the plugin protocols
  * The controller class for the UI DivvyYourPluginNameController
  * The UI DivvyYourPluginName.xib
  * The property list DivvyYourPluginName-Info.plist
  * The data model DivvyYourPluginName.xcdatamodel
  * These should all be assigned to a loadable bundle target in Xcode called DivvyYourPluginName, and compile to DivvyYourPluginName.plugin (not the .bundle default)

= Data Model =
  * At least one entity called YourPluginName
  * YourPluginName entity is assigned to the DivvyYourPluginName configuration (in wrench segment of rightmost panel of the data modeling tool in Xcode)
  * YourPluginName entity is assigned the class DivvyYourPluginName

= Property List =
  * "Main nib file base name" is DivvyYourPluginName
  * "Principal class" is DivvyYourPluginName
  * You will have to add these entries to the plist

= UI =
  * "Raises For Not Applicable Keys" must *not* be checked in any bindings to parameters of your plugin
